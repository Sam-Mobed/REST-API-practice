# Secure API with Node.js and Express.js

A secure API I coded by following a youtube tutorial at the following link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw5LupcpKS4 .

The purpose behind this repo is to practice writing an API, for a project that I have in mind. 

I'm also using nodemon as a dependency, to facilitate development. 

## Why secure APIs?

* Protecting data: APIs often expose sensitive data or functionality, such as user data, authentication mechanisms, and payment processing. Securing your API ensures that this information is protected from unauthorized access and misuse.
* Preventing attacks: APIs can be vulnerable to various types of attacks, such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Securing your API can help prevent these attacks by implementing security measures, such as input validation, encryption, and rate limiting.
* Maintaining trust: APIs are often used by third-party developers, partners, and customers. Securing your API helps maintain trust with these stakeholders by ensuring that their data and resources are protected from threats and attacks.
* Compliance: Many industries and regulatory bodies have specific security requirements for APIs. Securing your API ensures compliance with these requirements and avoids potential legal and financial consequences.
